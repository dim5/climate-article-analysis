# Climate Article Analysis

Welcome! This repository contains my Master's thesis work.

The `collector` folder contains a cross platform, polyglot, multi-service software solution that can scrape arbitrary news sites and extract article content.
It was used to collect articles in the topics of climate change and global warming.

The `analyzer` folder contains a set of Python scripts that I used during the exploratory data analysis phase of my thesis: scripts, to

- pre-process
- extract named entities
- cluster
- create a graph structure

from the collected articles.

For more details see the specific `readme`s in each folder.
